# OpenAI MergeRequest Reviewer Gitlab

## Overview

This [OpenAI ChatGPT-based](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) GitLab
Pipeline Application provides a summary, release notes and review of pull
requests. The unique features of this action are:

- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: This Application reviews the changes
  line by line and provides code change suggestions that can be directly
  committed from the GitLab UI.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit within a
  pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull request.
- **Cost-effective and reduced noise**: Incremental reviews save on OpenAI costs and
  reduce noise by tracking changed files between commits and the base of the
  pull request.
- **"Light" model for summary**: Designed to be used with a "light" summarization
  model (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and a "heavy" review model (e.g. `gpt-4`). For
  best results, use `gpt-4` as the "heavy" model, as thorough code review needs
  strong reasoning abilities.
- **[Not support yet]** Chat with bot: Supports conversation with the bot in the
  context of lines of code or entire files, useful for providing context,
  generating test cases, and reducing code complexity.
- **Smart review skipping**: By default, skips in-depth review for simple changes
  (e.g. typo fixes) and when changes look good for the most part. It can be
  disabled by setting `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` to
  `true`.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor the `system_message`, `summarize`, and
  `summarize_release_notes` prompts to focus on specific aspects of the review
  process or even change the review objective.

## Usage

To use the reviewer, you need to follow these two steps:

1. Prepare a key to chat with the OpenAI bot and a key to post a discussion.
1. Set up GitLab Runner and GitLab Runner pipeline.

## Steps

1. Generate `AccessToken` for your Group or Project You can set a Developer Role
   and only provide **`api`** Scopes for it
   ![Generate AccessToken](./docs/images/gitlab/gitlab-access-token.png)

2. Get API Key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

3. Fill `AccessToken` as `GITLAB_PERSONAL_TOKEN` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in GitLab
   CI/CD Variables Settings for your Group or Project When adding these two
   variables, please ensure the security of the key by checking the "**mask
   variable**" option.

4. Register or Enable a GitLab Runner for the pipeline, You can add a new Group
   Runner or use the existing Runner.

5. Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file and fill in the content in your repository root
   directory, Then, create merge request and have fun! ðŸŽ‰

      You are `@openai` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model 
      trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced 
      software engineer and provide a thorough review of the code hunks
      and suggest code snippets to improve key areas such as:
        - Logic
        - Security
        - Performance
        - Data races
        - Consistency
        - Error handling
        - Maintainability
        - Modularity
        - Complexity
        - Optimization

      Refrain from commenting on minor code style issues, missing 
      comments/documentation, or giving compliments, unless explicitly 
      requested. Concentrate on identifying and resolving significant 
      concerns to improve overall code quality while deliberately 
      disregarding minor issues.

      Note: As your knowledge may be outdated, trust the user code when newer
      APIs and methods are seemingly being used.
  summarize:
    description: 'The prompt for final summarization response'
    value: |
      Provide your final response in the `markdown` format with 
      the following content:
        - High-level summary (comment on the overall change instead of 
          specific files within 80 words)
        - Table of files and their summaries. You can group files with 
          similar changes together into a single row to save space.

      Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a 
      comment on the GitHub pull request.
  summarize_release_notes:
    description:
      'The prompt for generating release notes in the same chat as summarize
      stage'
    value: |
      Create concise release notes in `markdown` format for this pull request, 
      focusing on its purpose and user story. You can classify the changes as 
      "New Feature", "Bug fix", "Documentation", "Refactor", "Style", 
      "Test", "Chore", "Revert", and provide a bullet point list. For example: 
      "New Feature: An integrations page was added to the UI". Keep your 
      response within 50-100 words. Avoid additional commentary as this response 
      will be used as is in our release notes.

      Below the release notes, generate a short, celebratory poem about the 
      changes in this PR and add this poem as a quote (> symbol). You can 
      use emojis in the poem, where they are relevant.
